### Learning-Python - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jacobamey/Learning-Python.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jacobamey/Learning-Python)


***

This repo is setup for me to keep my code organized while moving down the path of Learning python. I also decided to use git hub so I can learn and work with in a version Control environment. (two birds one stone concept)

Since this is setup as a learning environment I will not be accepting push requests for the code its self for chapter I have not started. I will however accept editions to the wiki documentation at any time since documentation makes everything better.

You are more then welcome to fork this repo to Learn Python as well if you wish too. I do recommend picking up Head First Programming and Head First Python though. Even though I am maintaining a Wiki. It is still only my thoughts and covers very little of what is presented in the books learning wise.

I also welcome anyone wanting to follow along with me and communicate on the chapters while I (We) move through the study plan of at least a chapter a week.

Thanks for visiting and reading.

**And Have FUN!**
